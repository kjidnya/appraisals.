<h3>Why should we choose you for those positions??</h3>
I am capable of this role bcoz i can handle all responsibilities assigned,with dedication,cooprate with other team for there work.
I can manage my team in tight working enviornments like recent teacher's day and engineer's day event of ours.
I am capable for this role because of my cultural skills like painting,dancing etc.Representing cultural team and 
being part of our college's cultural team makes it eaiser
to build the bridge for students to connect with aces and cultural team.
I believe that I can provide great value to aces cultural team's growth further.
My abilities to manage the events for cultural and cooradinating performances at events,
also the  experience i have gained at aces cultural has made me understand its work environment,culture,and the procedures for the events.
As a result i strongly believed to be choosen as ACES culturalhead.<br>
